The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem is a prominent area of research
in the mobile robotics community. For the past years, there have been considerable advancements
in this area. Although researchers have developed efficient algorithms to solve the
problem, there are only a few quantitative studies that focus on the comparison of the different
approaches used. For this project, the proponents will present a comparison of three
approaches to help solve the SLAM problem: the Estimation-Theoretic or Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) approach, the Expectation Maximization (EM) approach, and the Particle Filter
or FastSlam approach.
